# gerp ðŸ’¨

## what is gerp ?
The "gerp" ðŸŒ¬ðŸ’¨ command is a joke command like the "sl" ðŸš‚ command.<br>
This command is a joke program developed to trick my boss who often mistakes "grep" for "gerp".

("gerp" is a word that reminds Japanese of the burp sound.)

## thanks

A ["sl" command] (https://github.com/mtoyoda/sl) is a copyrighted work of [Toyoda Masashi](http://www.tkl.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~toyoda/).<br>
The "gerp" command is created with reference to the "sl" command and performs a similar operation, but the content of the source code is different.
